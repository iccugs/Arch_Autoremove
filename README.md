Simple script for Arch Linux (and Arch based distros) to use options of the pacman command to autoremove packages that are not explicitly installed to your operating system (ie. old dependencies that are no longer required, etc.) and to autoclean the pamac repository cache.  In essence, this is meant automate the simplicity of using the autoremove and autoclean options for the aptitude package manager for debian based linux distributions. All you should have to do is chmod +x this script and run it as you would any other shell script from the command line (ie. "./autoremove.sh").
